        <h1>Hacking Ming's server</h1>
        <h1>Alternate title: Happy HackMing</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            You've all heard of <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>, the not-so-cool
            ride sharing app that showed Millenials the dark side of Brogrammers and uncontrolled
            free-market capitalism. Well, today, I've been hired not to hack into Uber, but into
            the one and only Ming Chow's "NotUber," which, while not exactly mobile-friendly,
            certainly will not be featured in any scathing New York Times articles in the near
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ming's NotUber is simple: a user submits a request to <a href="http://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com">
            the (now hacked) server</a>, with a username, a latitude, and a longitude. The server then
            returns a list of passengers or drivers who are available and also using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was hired to find vulnerabilities in the way the server is built, and boy, did I ever.
        </p>
        <h3>A quick note</h3>
        <p>
            I didn't hack the server itself, but rather a copy of it. This copy was run locally on
            my machine, and excluded a whitelist for passengers, which does exist in the actual server.
        </p>
        <h3>Another quick note</h3>
        <p>
            My original partner for this project sent me a server that was incomplete and didn't run. For
            that reason, I'm hacking Ming's server, and not his. I guess, though, that a broken server
            is indeed un-hackable!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            To hack Ming's server, I first did some simple probing a la "Black Box testing", that
            is, I tried to break things without looking at the source code. After that, I cracked
            open the ol' server.js and scanned it for vulnerabilities. I didn't use very many tools -
            or at least I didn't find much success with them - but I did rely on PostMan to do a lot
            of GET and POST requests for me, so that I wasn't constantly using curl's gross interface.
        </p>
        <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            The server, if it doesn't include a whitelist for passengers or drivers, is horrendously
            vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). Anybody can send in their username as a malicious bit of
            JavaScript and render the homepage of the server unusable.
            <br />
            Outside of XSS, the database is pretty good, and could be strengthened with just a bit
            of extra vigilance. Notably, though, any user as of right now can send a vehicle.json request
            with the username slightly modified and get a dump of the first element inside the database,
            which could be used maliciously for sure.
            <br />
            Aside from that, the server doesn't bother to authorize its users in any way. That is, even if
            I'm not user JANET, I can say I am, enter a latitude and longitude, and voila, there's a new
            entry in the server with JANET's name and a fake location. This could be a BIG issue if
            many users realize this.
        </p>
        <h2>Issues Found</h2>
            <h3>1. XSS</h3>
                <br />
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="xss.png" alt="XSS hacking">
                    <div>The server is hacked with XSS</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    Cross-Site-Scripting, or XSS, is a notorious security flaw all over the internet.
                    Unfortunately, Ming's server is no exception. In the example pictured above, all I did
                    was send a post request to localhost:3000/submit with my username as "<code>alert(hacked!);</code>",
                    inside of two script tags, and the homepage ceased to load without first showing that alert. A more malicious
                    attacker could get creative, redirecting to a similar-looking page that tracks keystrokes or
                    credit card info. All bad stuff.
                    <h4>Where is it?</h4>
                    This issue is located in the /submit section of the server.
                    <h4>Is it bad, doc?</h4>
                    No, not if you hurry up and fix it. If you don't fix it, then you're essentially screwed.
                    There's no limit to what can be done to this site.
                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    Add a whitelist of usernames that the POST to /sumbit will accept. If the username
                    submitted isn't in the whitelist, don't accept it. The official server already has this
                    implemented, and it works:
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="whitelist.png" alt="Whitelist code">
                    </div>
                </p>
            <h3>2. Database injection</h3>
                <br />
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="dbinject.png" alt="XSS">
                    <div>The server is hacked with database injection</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    A database injection - in other words, I tricked the database into accepting
                    one of my sumitted usernames as a command. As you can see in the image above, I
                    sent a GET /vehicle.json request with a funky query string. Specifically, that string
                    is "/vehicle.json?username%5B%24exists%5D%3D", which translates to "/vehicle.json?username[$exists]=".
                    This submission makes the database release the most recent driver submitted through the POST /submit
                    route. In other words, you don't have to know the name of a driver to get their data. That's an issue!
                    <h4>Where is it?</h4>
                    This issue is located in the /vehicle.json section of the server.
                    <h4>Is it bad, doc?</h4>
                    Like XSS, it's not terrible, but it will be if it's not fixed. It's also a little trickier to make a
                    solution. If you don't fix it, this could cause a lot of issues, which I'll explain
                    in my next problem with the program.
                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    A big issue here, in case you didn't notice, is that the GET /vehicle.json request doesn't have an
                    equals sign after the username. If you look at the code, specifically where the username to be searched
                    for in the database is pulled from the query, it looks like this: <code>var usernameEntry = request.query.username;</code>.
                    I'm no databse expert, but my guess is that that behavior allows the server to interpret any old entry
                    as the username, including a malicioius injection, as the "username" entry.
                    What I think you should do, then, is, once you've found the username, before searching for it in the database,
                     assert that it's a string, with no non-alphanumeric characters in it. That doesn't totally solve this
                    vulnerability, but it should make it at least a little bit more difficult to break into. This can be done pretty
                    simply with some JavaScript: <code>if(username.search(/[^A-Za-z\s]/) != -1) {alert("bad username!");}</code>
                </p>
            <h3>3. No authorization</h3>
                <br />
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="noauth1.png" alt="No Authorization (before)">
                    <div>Server results before my hack</div>
                </div>
                <br />
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="noauth2.png" alt="No Authorization (after)">
                    <div>Server results after my hack (the first entry is different!)</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    This is perhaps the most troubling issue this server has. There is no authorization protocol
                    in place for submission of any sort to the server, other than having a valid username. In other
                    words, as soon as I find a legit username as a driver or as a passenger, I can send totally
                    made-up information to the server under that username. In the two pictures above, I modified
                    the position of user "adam" with a simple post to /submit.
                    What makes this even more worrying is that, as it stands, every username that is submitted to
                    the server can be found very easily. All the passengers are listed on GET /, and if I wrote a
                    script to carry out the database injection that I detailed above and parse the results for
                    every new username that comes in, I can also get a list of every valid driver. From there, I can
                    submit over and over again using valid usernames that aren't mine and totally crap data.
                    I could use this to dispatch drivers to totally ridiculous locations to pick up users that
                    don't need a ride, or I could use it to call a car for a user who doesn't want one, so that when
                    they're not there to pick up their car, they get fined for being absent, as Uber does.
                    <h4>Where is it?</h4>
                    This issue is mainly in the /submit part of the server, but information used to exploit it
                    can be found in GET / and GET /vehicle.json.
                    <h4>Is it bad, doc?</h4>
                    Yes. This will be a bit of work to fix, but will be absolutely catastrophic if you don't fix it.
                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    Here's what I would do: first, notify passengers and vehicles that they're going to need to set
                    up a new account, with their internal username staying the same, but with a new outward-facing username,
                    and a password. For example, if my username right now were "JANET", I'd need to set up a new account. My
                    internal username would still be "JANET", but my outward-facing username, what customers would see, would be
                    something like "JanDrives". I also need a password: "JanetRocks01!".
                    Then, the server would have to be modified. In order to submit a request to ride or pick up, you'd need to submit
                    your inward-facing username, password, and lat and lng. If the username and password don't check out, don't let them
                    into the server.
                    GET / would, instead of showing internal usernames, show outward-facing ones. And no passwords, of course.
                    You'd also need to fix the database injection that I outlined above, so that people can't steal usernames of drivers
                    that don't belong to them.
                    With all this in place, you should be OK. Just be sure to encrypt everything along the way, especially passwords.
                </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This could be worse, but it could also be a lot better. To be honest, I'd restructure
                the whole user interface here to not allow them to see anything but other usernames.
                It's too risky to allow them to get a vechicle's info. Put the whitelists in place,
                make sure all user input is less risky, and clean up the interface, and you should have a
                mildly safer product!
            </p>
