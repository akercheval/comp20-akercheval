# Finalizing My Learning Portfolio

## 1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This git repository stores the work that I did for some (but not all) of my COMP20
assignments during the spring 2017 semester.
## 2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
Silly as it was, I really enjoyed the "annotations" assignment, in which we inserted
captions to Mariah Carey's tragic performance at the 2017 New Year's Eve ceremony. Getting the
lyrics to match up to the video was a surprisingly challenging activity, and figuring out
how to do that taught me a whole lot about JavaScript and got me to get familiar with
dictionaries, which are a lovely data structure.
## 3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
Quite a bit! I knew a little web-related stuff coming in to this course, but it was mainly
front-end, and I certainly didn't have the ability to create a functioning and not boring website by myself.
Now, that's totally possible.
## 4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
Again, odd answer, but I find the chrome developer tools to be incredibly valuable. It's fantastic for
debugging, and includes a whole lot of information that I didn't know it had: the console, for instance,
was totally alien to me before it was introduced to us, as was the network tab. And I just discovered the
security tab, which will certainly be fun to play with.
It also is super cool, because now I can see a site that I like and literally look at the source code, right
there! My days of wondering "how did they do that?" are over.
## 5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'm really interested in seeing what else I can do with the concept of a server. What else can I serve?
How can I manipulate the data to do server-side computations? Maybe, then, big data and networking is a
logical follow-up. Also, security! That seems to be a huge world with a lot to learn, but the intro that
we got in 20 was really intriguing to me.
